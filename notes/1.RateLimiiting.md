# Rate Limiting
Rate limiting allows to control incoming/outgoing traffic. Let's assume server is allowed to server 100 request/min, if it exceeds more the allowed limit, it will fail to handle the request. Rate limiting comes into picture here.

## scenario's
- DDOS attack
- Number of allowed request for an user e.g Google maps

## Benefits of Rate limiting
- User experience - this limits over usage of api and abuse the system, so that other user have fair experience with the system.
- Security - one of the key feature of rate limiting is security which avoids some attacks like brute force.
- Operational Cost - Rate limiting avoids surge in operational cost due to attacks.

## Types of Rate limiting
- **User Based:** This defines how many user can access the system at any point of time.
- **Concurrent Based:** This defines how many concurrent calls can user make at given point of time.
- **Location/IP Based** This defines how many request can be severed in given location at given time.
- **Server Based** This depends of server/resources capability, to serve the request.

## Rate limiting Algorithm's
### Token Based
### Bucket Flow
### Window Counter 
### Sliding log
